# supertest-examples
In this space, I experiment with Supertest against some public APIs.

## Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

## Getting Started
To run tests:
```
npm install
npm test
```

## TODOs
- Finish testing [restful-booker]
- Setup some useful reporting
- Discover other interesting APIs to test from [this list](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)

## Suggestions & Requests
Have a suggestion for a public API to test, or want to request a test for a specific feature or scenario? Feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/treyturner/supertest-examples/issues/new) on GitHub.
